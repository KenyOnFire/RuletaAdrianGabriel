# European Roulette in Korge

This project is made by Adrián and Gabriel for the Multimedia Programming and Mobile Devices course. We are using the Korge framework since Kotlin is a language we have studied during this course. We are also implementing the firebase SDK modified by GitLive to work cross-platform. Thank you very much for all the support to @soywiz
